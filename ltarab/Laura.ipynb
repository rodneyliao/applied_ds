    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The data set tracks VAERS, which is the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System for the year 2015. This information is obtained by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). \n",
    "\n",
    "##### The data set details include vaccine names, manufacturers, manufacturer’s lot numbers, vaccine doses, administration routes, and anatomical sites where the vaccine was administered. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Additionally, the primary information data provides age, sex, symptoms reported, and the following adverse events outcomes: Died, Life Threatening, ER visit, Hospitalized, Days Hospitalized, Disabled, Recovered, Vaccination Data, Onset Date, Onset Interval, Other Medications, Current Illnesses, Prior Vaccination and Condition History.

    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Vaccination is facing increasing public health pressures and it is important to note if the drug formulations themselves are becoming more advanced through new administration techniques that could be more direct and less potentially prone to adverse events. Additionally, there is increased public debate regarding the appropriate age of vaccination and what combinations of vaccinations to be given at a time. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### The VAERS form strives to collect data across a broad spectrum of variables, however, it is biased in the sense that vaccines where no adverse events occurred are not recorded by the reporting system, or at least that data is not available in the 2018 sample set. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### With any incomplete date set, especially one that has the potential to influence public health policy and that has the power to sway decision making in the regulatory sphere it is important to have clear transparency in the data you are utilizing to guide your predictive models and to state its limitations within the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### It is further important to make an inference on how the outcomes can change with the introduction of missing variables and the impact that would have on the model. In this particular scenario, it would be necessary to understand why the surveys were not collected on no adverse events and address if it would play a significant role on the questions posed. Based on literature review on adverse event reporting within the clinical setting, the nature of the way the data is collected is misleading. The survey is only available when an event occurs that signals a negative adverse event. The system itself is not set up to collect all vaccination events and thus record all outcomes, both positive and negative. This will be critical to note in the analysis and in the recommendations made moving forward.\n"
