A 4-year-old boy presented with a 1-month history of three soft, pruritic, subcutaneous, 1-cm mobile nodules on the anterior left and right thighs with overlying hypopigmentation, excoriated dermatitis, and moderate xerosis. The patient had a history of persistent cervical lymphadenopathy of the right anterior and lateral neck, eczema on the flanks and upper buttock, and keratosis pilaris on the posterior bilateral arms. Viral studies were unremarkable except for detectible immunoglobulin G antibodies to Epstein–Barr virus indicating a previous infection. The patient's family first observed the nodules after he had received a hepatitis A vaccine (manufacturer unknown) in the left thigh 1 month before. The patient received six vaccinations: three doses of the diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio vaccine – Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate vaccine and three doses of the pneumococcal vaccine. There was no record of where on the patient these vaccines were administered. His scheduled vaccination program was continued after he and his family moved. A punch biopsy of a nodule on the left anterior thigh was performed for histopathologic examination. A punch biopsy specimen demonstrated lobular panniculitis with a dense infiltrate composed of lymphocytes, histiocytes, plasma cells, numerous eosinophils, and clusters of dendritic Langerhans cells. Stains for microorganisms were unrevealing. The patient underwent patch testing and at 96 hours had a 2+ positive reaction to 2.0% aluminum chloride hexahydrate. In the months after, the patient developed diffuse hypopigmented patches on his trunk and overlying the thigh nodules. The patient was diagnosed with aluminum hypersensitivity. The outcome of events was unknown. The authors considered the events to be related to aluminium salts used as adjuvants in vaccines, including hepatitis A vaccine (manufacturer unknown).",,,,,,,,,U,,,,,UNK,,,,Medical History/Concurrent Conditions: Eczema (on the flanks and upper buttock); Epstein-Barr virus infection; Keratosis pilaris (on the posterior bilateral arms); Lymphadenopathy cervical (right anterior and lateral neck),,US0095075131712USA003882,2,1/2/18,,,,

Within an hour of my flu shot I developed significant blurred vision and confusion and went on to develop some intense joint pain with fatigue later that day and into the night. I normally do not have neurological problems and I have perfect vision at baseline. My questions are as follows: 1. What is the lot number of the flu vaccination I received and what are the specific additives? 2. Are there other people who received the flu vaccination this year that had adverse side effects similar to myself? 3. Who is responsible for reporting this adverse reaction to the CDC or other pertinent agencies? 4. What are the recommendations for future flu shots based on my reaction to this one? Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. Follow up email received 1/3/18: I never had any tests or ER visits done.

Additional information was provided. This case was reported in a literature article and described the occurrence of systemic lupus erythematosus in a 17-year-old female who was vaccinated with MENVEO (GlaxoSmithKline). The patient was a previously healthy female. Her immunizations were up to date. The patient had no history of vaccine reactions, allergic reactions, recent travel, known sick contacts, animal exposure, or significant outdoor activity. She did not take any medications regularly. No information on family history was provided. On an unspecified date, the patient received MENVEO (administration route and site unspecified; dosages unknown; batch number not provided). On an unspecified date, an evening after the vaccination, the patient began to feel ill. 5 days prior to the emergency department (ED) visit, the patient developed a progressive, erythematous, non-pruritic, non-painful facial rash. Prior to ED presentation, the patient received 2 days of cefadroxil and there was no improvement in her symptoms. Review of systems was positive only for mild right-sided neck pain. 15 days after receiving the vaccine, the patient presented to ED with 14 days of fever and fatigue. Initial vital signs included a blood pressure of 110/61 mmHg, heart rate of 102 bpm, respiratory rate of 20, an oxygen saturation of 97% and a temporal temperature of 102.4 degree F (39.1 deg. C). She was an ill appearing female with a non-blanching, erythematous maculopapular facial rash, including the right periorbital region and bilateral upper cheeks, with extension to the right ear. The rash was associated with mild right periorbital swelling, as well as perioral dermatitis and dry, chapped lips. She had a painless ulceration of the hard palate. Her first, second, and third fingertips revealed non-painful, purpuric lesions bilaterally. Neck exam was significant for palpable right posterior cervical chain lymphadenopathy without meningismus. The remainder of her exam was unremarkable. Complete blood count (CBC) revealed pancytopenia. The white blood cells (WBC) was 2.8 (neutrophils 48% with 13% bands; there were 35% lymphocytes and 4% monocytes); the HgB was 10.2 and the platelets were 48,000 (normal values not provided).

All other initial labs were unremarkable, electrocardiogram (EKG) and chest x-ray (CXR) were normal. Computed tomography (CT) of the head and neck revealed diffuse bilateral lymphadenopathy. The patient was admitted to the Medical intensive care unit (ICU). On Day 2, despite empiric antibiotic therapy, the patient's CBC demonstrated worsening pancytopenia, with WBC 1.7. Prednisone was started and her pancytopenia began to resolve. All cultures were negative and antibiotics were discontinued on Day 5. On Day 7 she was started on the immunosuppressant CELLCEPT; her fever and rash improved. Serological testing was positive for SLE (antinuclear antibodies titer of 1:320 and anti-double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid titer of 1:640). On Day 9, the patient was discharged with prednisone and mycophenolate and PLAQUENIL. At one-month follow up, the patient was doing well. This case has been considered serious due to hospitalisation. The authors commented, 'In our case, the extreme proximity of the vaccination to the clinical symptoms, and the pathognomonic serologic findings argues in favour of a cause and effect relationship between the vaccine and classical SLE'.

On an unknown date, 183 days after receiving Meningococcal ACWY vaccine and Meningococcal B Recom vaccine + AIOH + OMV, the subject developed vaccination failure. Serious criteria included death and GSK medically significant. Additional event(s) included meningococcal infection with serious criteria of death and GSK medically significant. The outcome of vaccination failure was fatal. The outcome(s) of the additional event(s) included meningococcal infection (fatal). The reported cause of death was meningococcal infection. The investigator considered that there was a reasonable possibility that the vaccination failure and meningococcal infection may have been caused by Meningococcal ACWY and Meningococcal B Recom vaccine + AIOH + OMV. Relevant Tests: Lab tests were performed on an unspecified date. The isolate initially was reported to be serogroup B, but subsequent testing at the Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention  (CDC) revealed that the strain actually was non-groupable. The isolate sequence type (ST-2578) was associated more commonly with asymptomatic carriage rather than invasive disease. Additional information was provided.

On an unspecified date, approximately 6 months after vaccinations and 1 month after eculizumab therapy, the patient developed meningococcal disease.

The isolate sequence type (ST-2578) was associated more commonly with asymptomatic carriage rather than invasive disease. On an unspecified date, the patient died despite apparently strong memory antibody response to the strain. Thus, a normally non-pathogenic strain led to fatal illness despite vaccination.

On an unknown date, the outcome of the pain in arm and injected limb mobility decreased were not recovered/not resolved. The reporter considered the pain in arm to be related to FLUARIX Quadrivalent. It was unknown if the reporter considered the injected limb mobility decreased to be related to FLUARIX Quadrivalent. Additional details were reported as follows: The patient received FLUARIX Quadrivalent in right deltoid. The patient noted he had pain from the AFLURIA flu vaccine in 2016, which was given to him in his left arm and that is why he chose the right arm with the present vaccine. The patient had arm pain at the injection area after the vaccine, which he thought it was just the shot, but he continued to have right arm pain still. The patient had a really painful arm which was hurting and he cannot lift his arm beyond the ear. The patient reported these events to the pharmacy in December. The pharmacist was unaware if these events had been reported by the patient to his physician. The patient denied any other vaccines on his questionnaire, when he was asked about other vaccines on this day or 4 weeks prior to this vaccination. It was reported that, the pharmacist who gave the vaccine was no longer working at the pharmacy. The pharmacist stated that, it was their protocol to report to VAERS. She was encouraged to follow her protocols and make aware GlaxoSmithKline would report to VAERS as well. The pharmacist reported that, the patient requested manufacturer's phone number.

Co-suspect products included ANORO ELLIPTA inhalation powder (batch number 7ZP4425, expiry date June 2019 for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The patient's past medical history included retention carbon dioxide, oxygen saturation decreased, feeling unwell (patient was placed on bi-pap and antibiotic spent a week in hospital then 1 week in skilled nursing facility), x-ray, bilevel positive airway pressure and living in nursing home (1 week).

On 5th October 2017, the patient received Influenza vaccine and ANORO ELLIPTA (inhaled) 1 puff(s) once daily. On 5th October 2017, less than a day after receiving Influenza vaccine and ANORO ELLIPTA and less than a day after starting Influenza vaccine and ANORO ELLIPTA, the patient experienced bronchitis.

On 17th November 2017, the patient experienced feeling unwell. On 28th November 2017, the patient experienced missed dose. On an unknown date, the patient experienced blood streaked sputum and scab. The patient was treated with azithromycin. ANORO ELLIPTA was interrupted (Dechallenge was positive). On an unknown date, the outcome of the bronchitis and blood streaked sputum were recovered/resolved and the outcome of the feeling unwell, scab and missed dose were unknown and the outcome of the phlegm, hoarseness, nausea, appetite absent, breast pain, chest pain, gagging, runny nose, tiredness and vomiting were recovering/resolving.

The reporter considered the phlegm, hoarseness, nausea, appetite absent, breast pain, chest pain, gagging, runny nose, tiredness and vomiting to be possibly related to Influenza vaccine and ANORO ELLIPTA. Additional details were provided as follows: Additional concomitant medications included unspecified antibiotic, prenatal vitamin, unspecified pain medication as needed, and unspecified nasal spray. Caller was recently prescribed ANORO which patient has started on 5th October 2017. The patient had recently been in the hospital for carbon dioxide retention and low oxygen saturation levels. She was also placed on an antibiotic and her prednisone was increased to 20 milligram from 10 mg. She noted a x-ray was done at that time. She spent a week in the hospital on bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) and then another week at a skilled nursing facility on BiPAP. The patient saw her physician on 5th October 2017, and was told to start ANORO by her pulmonologist. She has been prescribed ANORO by her primary care physician in August but never started it. She was previously taking SPIRIVA and DULERA. The patient also stated that, at the 5th October 2017 visit, she got a flu shot. She saw him on 13th October 2017, as a follow-up appointment and was given doxycycline but she was not sure why. On 18th October 2017, she received a pneumonia shot.

She also noted prior to this visit with the bronchitis diagnosis she had got a capsule lodged in her throat. The patient stated she was sticking her finger in her throat trying to get it out, drinking and coughing. She stated it finally went down and believed it broke and was cutting her. She was having some blood tinged sputum and she also coughed up what she thought was a scab. The patient did not take her ANORO on 28th November 2017 because she thought that was what was causing the excess phlegm and she felt like she was full of it. She also noted hoarseness, cough, nausea, lack of appetite, the pain in her right breast area that went around her chest were all related to the ANORO. Additional adverse events reported included gagging, runny nose, tired, and vomiting phlegm.

733092,1/9/18,MD,,,,U,,"Information has been received from the authors in a letter to the editor and refers to retrospective epidemiologic assessment involving 3811 employees. The authors found a nonlinear decline in mumps seropositivity over time, with a sharp decrease 13 years after the most recent measles–mumps–rubella (MMR) vaccine dose on the basis of antibody titers obtained at the outset of employee training with the use of the BioPlex 2200 MMRV IgG multiplex flow immunoassay (Bio-Rad). Seropositivity fell below the estimated herd-immunity threshold among those last vaccinated at least 16 years earlier. Since recent mumps outbreaks have occurred in populations that had been vaccinated as children, the findings raise concern about the need for routine administration of MMR vaccine in young adults entering congregated settings, such as colleges and employee training. This case refers to 45 employees of unspecified ages and genders. The patient's concurrent conditions, medical history or concomitant medications were not reported. On unspecified dates from 1998 to 2014, 73 patients were vaccinated with two doses of Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (Wistar RA 27-3) Virus Vaccine, Live (manufacturer unknown) as prophylaxis (dose, frequency, lot number and expiration date were not reported), from which  6 patients developed mumps on unspecified dates. 7 patients received three doses of Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (Wistar RA 27-3) Virus Vaccine, Live (manufacturer unknown). On unspecified dates from 2015 to 2016,  2 patients were vaccinated with one dose  of Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (Wistar RA 27-3) Virus Vaccine, Live (manufacturer unknown) as prophylaxis (dose, frequency, lot number and expiration date were not reported). Both patients developed mumps on unspecified dates; 18 patients received two doses of Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (Wistar RA 27-3) Virus Vaccine, Live (manufacturer unknown) from which 10 developed mumps on unspecified dates; 14 patients received three doses of Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (Wistar RA 27-3) Virus Vaccine, Live (manufacturer unknown) from which 2 patients developed mumps on unspecified dates.

The authors performed a retrospective chart review to assess hepatitis B titers in children with celiac disease and whether baseline titers were affected by the presence of other autoimmune diseases, gender or vitamin D levels. 67 children that had a baseline hepatitis B titer after the primary vaccine series for hepatitis B were involved. The average age of diagnosis of celiac disease was 6.74 years. The majority (60/67) were diagnosed via endoscopic biopsy while 10.4% (7/67) were diagnosed via serology based on Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (SPGHAN) guidelines. Thirty-six (53.7%) were male and 31 (46.3%) were female. 60.6% of children (40/66) had normal vitamin D-25 levels. Of the 67 children, 25 (37.3%) had positive hepatitis B surface antibody levels and 42 (62.7%) had negative hepatitis B surface antibody levels. There was no difference in response to the initial primary hepatitis B vaccine (recombinant) (manufacturer unknown) series based on gender. Twenty-three percent of children (6/26) with vitamin D levels <30 ng/mL (considered as low) and 45% of children (18/40) with vitamin D levels greater or equal to 30 ng/mL (normal level), had positive hepatitis titers (p=0.07). Twenty-one percent of children (3/14) with an additional autoimmune disease and 42% in children (22/53) without presence of an additional autoimmune disease, demonstrated hepatitis B immunity following primary vaccination (p=0.22). This literature report refers to 22 children of unknown gender (exact age was not provided) with celiac disease. On unknown dates, the patients were vaccinated with hepatitis B vaccine (recombinant) (manufacturer unknown) series (dose, route of administration, therapy type, lot# and expiration date were not reported) for prophylaxis. On unknown dates, the patients had negative hepatitis B surface antibody levels. They were not revaccinated due to lack of pediatrician awareness for need of vaccine as child already completed primary vaccine series, parents not making an appointment to get vaccine, and recent awareness of hepatitis B titer status.

Medical history, concurrent conditions, and concomitant medications were not provided.

This is conflicting information as the events associated were reported in 2015. The vaccine did not prevent shingles as intended, but rather caused the patient to contract a persistent strain of herpes zoster.

On or about 24-AUG-2015, the patient sought subsequent treatment at the same medical clinic (as on or about 28-JUL-2015) for uncontrolled pain and zoster outbreaks that had gotten worse in severity. On or about 31-AUG-2015, the female patient was treated again at the same medical clinic for continued shingles symptoms, nerve pain and scarring from the outbreaks. On or about 02-NOV-2015, the female was treated at the medical clinic for ongoing pain, at which time she was diagnosed with post-herpetic neuralgia, a chronic condition of nerve damage and pain secondary to zoster outbreaks. The female patient has been prescribed NEURONTIN, ZORIVAX (as reported), LYRICA, VALTREX and TYLENOL for management of her painful symptoms. As a direct and proximate result of these malfunctions, the patient suffered painful injuries and damages, and required extensive medical care and treatment.

On 14th August 2017, the patient received BOOSTRIX .5 ml. On 15th September 2017, 32 days after receiving BOOSTRIX, the patient experienced blurred vision (serious criteria disability), myopia (serious criteria disability), creatine phosphokinase increased (serious criteria disability) and feeling unwell. On 16th September 2017, the patient experienced walking difficulty (serious criteria disability), increased reflexes (serious criteria disability), myalgia of lower extremities (serious criteria disability), lower extremities weakness of (serious criteria disability), dizziness (serious criteria disability) and unable to walk. On an unknown date, the patient experienced paresthesia (serious criteria disability) and numbness (serious criteria disability). The patient was treated with Ear Drops {NOS} and TYLENOL. On an unknown date, the outcome of the blurred vision, walking difficulty, increased reflexes, paresthesia, numbness, myalgia of lower extremities, lower extremities weakness of, dizziness and unable to walk were not recovered/not resolved and the outcome of the myopia was unchanged and the outcome of the creatine phosphokinase increased and feeling unwell were unknown. The reporter considered the blurred vision, walking difficulty, increased reflexes, myopia, creatine phosphokinase increased, paresthesia, numbness, myalgia of lower extremities, lower extremities weakness of and dizziness to be possibly related to BOOSTRIX. It was unknown if the reporter considered the unable to walk and feeling unwell to be related to BOOSTRIX. Additional details were reported as follows: The physician was a pediatrician who did not work at the location where the vaccine was administered to the patient, who said that the nurse practitioner was responsible for the vaccine's administration at the clinic where the vaccine was administered. The patient's concomitant medication included ear drops starting from 14th August 2017. The reporter described that the patient's vision changed as being blurred vision but that was a subjective symptom because the pediatric eye examination was normal. On 15th September 2017, 32 days after vaccination, the patient was not feeling well, blood creatine phosphokinase increased and had myopia. The leg muscle pain was described as occurring in both legs with leg weakness in both legs. The difficulty in ambulating was described as the patient being unable to walk for more than a few steps. The dizziness occurred in the evening on the same day as the leg muscle pain with weakness and ambulation difficulty, which had occurred in the morning. On 16th September 2017, 33 days after vaccination, the patient experienced ambulation difficulty, mildly brisk reflexes, leg muscle pain and weakness, dizziness and unable to walk. On 16th September 2017 and 12th October 2017, the patient went to the emergency room because of the symptoms but was not admitted. The medical workup for this patient now included an ophthalmologist visit in which she was diagnosed with myopia and nothing else. The recent Blood creatine phosphokinase test results were pending. The patient recently started having numbness, tingling, and paresthesias which had been waxing and waning day to day. Less than a year after vaccination the patient experienced paresthesias, tingling, and numbness. On 13th October 2017, the patient was seen by a neurologist and the exam results were inconclusive, excepting diagnosis of mildly brisk reflex. On 13th October 2017, the patient had a normal cardiology workup. The patient had a pending Electroencephalography. The patient's parents were distraught and the reporter said these symptoms had been disabling that she had not been able to go back to school and was still unable to walk on her own most of the time. All of the symptoms were still waxing and waning from day to day. The reporter said the myopia could just be a baseline physical finding and was unsure if it was related to all of the other symptoms.

The following is verbatim from the article: The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), a group of medical and public health experts, meets 3 times per year to develop recommendations for vaccine use. The group has 15 voting members, and each member's term is 4 years. ACIP members and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) staff discuss the epidemiology of vaccine-preventable diseases and vaccine research, effectiveness, safety data, and clinical trial results. Representatives from multiple agencies are present as liaisons to the ACIP. The ACIP met on June 21 to 22, 2017, to discuss catch-up vaccination for hepatitis A vaccine, influenza surveillance, influenza vaccine effectiveness, herpes zoster vaccine, the effect of varicella vaccination on the incidence of herpes zoster, meningococcal disease in patients taking eculizumab, and considerations for a potential third dose of MMR vaccine to combat ongoing mumps outbreaks. Updates on dengue virus epidemiology, Zika virus vaccines, anthrax vaccine, yellow fever vaccine, and the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System were given also. This case involves a 16-year-old female patient who was vaccinated with doses of MENACWY VACCINE and MENB-4C VACCINES (batch number, expiry date, dose, dose in series, route and site of administration were not reported for both the vaccines) on an unspecified date. The patient had medical history of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. Concomitant medication includes eculizumab for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria which started on an unknown date approximately one month earlier. On an unspecified date, six months following the vaccinations, the patient experienced fatal meningococcal disease and vaccination failure. Laboratory investigation and corrective treatment were not reported. On an unknown date, the patient died despite apparently strong memory antibody response to the strain. It was unknown if autopsy was performed or not. List of the documents held by sender: none. Sender's Comments: Vaccination failure may be expected with any vaccine, as no vaccine protects all vaccinated individuals. Concomitant medication in this report of fatal meningococcal disease included eculizumab for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. Eculizumab is a terminal complement inhibitor and therefore increases patient risk for meningococcal infections. Patients treated with eculizumab and without a history of prior vaccination are recommended to receive a meningococcal vaccine at least 2 weeks prior to receiving the first dose of eculizumab and be revaccinated according to current medical guidelines for vaccine use. In this case, vaccination with MenACWY and MenB meningococcal vaccines occurred prior to initiating treatment with eculizumab. Importantly, this case does not represent a confirmed vaccine failure to MenACWY because information on the specific serogroup involved was not available. The isolate initially was reported to be serogroup B, but subsequent testing revealed that the strain actually was nongroupable.

The patient underwent lensetomy on an unspecified date. Historical condition included dysinteria (dates not reported). Current condition included low blood pressure since an unspecified date. The patient was broad-shouldered, with a 30-inch waistline. The patient was fit, muscular and athletic. The patient's resting heart rate was 53 and did not have any known allergies.

It was reported that, approximately 1 week after the vaccination, the patient suffered from a systemic attack and the patient was unsure of what system. On 26-Aug-2017 or on 27-Aug-2017, the patient went for swimming. After a few strokes, he had to stop as he felt soreness in his both elbows. Since that time, he had done little swimming and no push-ups at all. The patient also experienced tenderness. On an unspecified date, the patient went to gym to lift weights and he was unable to lift it from the rack. Bilateral arms triceps would twitch after lifting bars at the gym. He also tried doing push-up but he couldn't do more than 3, prior he could do many triceps before the flu shot. The patient also had soreness in his left arm. He recalled thinking that he was coming down with an illness of some kind. He experienced extreme weakness in bilateral arms and he could not exercise as he was not getting enough strength. In the following week he began to experience a number of physical maladies. From time to time his biceps would twitch in tandem and then they would be sore for few minutes or for few hours. As per patient, soreness caused mild discomfort but no pain, but an annoyance. The same thing would happen to his triceps, in tandem and subsequently the same phenomenon would appear in his forearms. From time to time, he found himself walking slowly, with mild discomfort in both groins. At the time of this report, he was able to function but not well and bilateral events had occurred several times over the course of the last 6-8 weeks (patient estimates it in dozens, occurring constantly, but at levels too slow to be perceived). In addition to these, the patient's hands were quick to fall asleep holding his cell phone, a book, or other small object. The patient stated that his arm fell asleep, but not in the usual way. He did not experience any constriction of blood flow but weakness and tingling. It used to happen any time and frequently happened at night (not every night but often). As the day passed by frequently felt tightening in his chest on the left side. In the past two or three weeks, he developed a strange sleeping pattern. Shortly after returning home from work, and eating, he ""shut down"" and fall asleep at 7:30 or 8 o'clock and used to awake 4 or 5 hours later, rested, but in a light sweat, with a mild headache or nausea, or all three. Again, he used to fall asleep at 4:30 or 5 AM, sleep restfully for 2 hours and awaken remarkably refreshed. His appetite has remained good throughout this ordeal, however in the absence of exercise he ate less and, consequently, his weight remained the same. About a month ago, the patient completely stopped taking alcohol otherwise he used to take moderate intake of alcohol. In the course of these past two months, a few things had been constant. Patient had experienced soreness at the site of the flu injection, and the weakness in his left arm had been more pronounced than his right. His elbows were both tender, not to the touch, but all on their own. On 30-Sep-2017, the patient found himself resting his left arm on the armrest, and then holding it in his right hand and he described it as it was like ""fighting through the distress"". On an unspecified date (reported as this Sunday), his left forearm began to ache and he struggled to maintain his composure. A day later the achiness had abated substantially. The patient was also diagnosed by carpal tunnel syndrome, but an EMG at Neurology has ruled it out, finding no nerve and muscle damage in his arms, wrists, and hands. On an unspecified date, the patient underwent EKG (electrocardiogram), a cat-scan (computed tomography), a lung x-ray and blood work which were all found negative (as reported). The patient did not have lyme disease or apparent autoimmune disease, but had been diagnosed with weakness caused by stress. He also experienced life-altering frustration, confusion, and fear. He had struggled to maintain the quality of his work, given up driving as he was fearful that his arms will fail him. The patient stated his social life had dwindled, healthy sex life had ground to a halt and pursuit of his hobbies had suffered. The patient was not given just a flu-shot, he was administered with an adjuvant intended to boost his immune system and he believed, the adjuvant was the cause of his distress. It was reported that, several weeks ago, one of his old friend and colleague reached out to shake his hand and when he extended it, they grasped his hand. He crumpled into his arms in pain. Since then, the patient reflexively recoil from an outstretched hand. On 20-Oct-2007, the patient began sauna sessions 2-3 twenty-minute sauna sessions daily, one in the morning before work, one or two in the evening depending on whether the patient swam at the gym. The first night after sauna, patient did not have night sweats or a sense of elevated fever. Before sauna visits, patient woke up every night with just under 100-101F fever and mild night sweats. Patient also noticed he no longer experienced mild nausea once starting sauna visits. Patient states he had no moisture on face or body after sauna initially, and felt the squalene adjuvant may have been preventing his body from sweating. After 1 week of sauna visits, sweat began to roll off face, and after 2 weeks of sauna visits, body is sweating normally. It was reported that, over past 2 days myalgia and heavy arms are improving and slept for 6 hours for the first time since the symptoms began. On an unspecified date, the patient recovered from the event ""left forearm began to ache"", myalgia and heavy arms. Outcome of other events were not reported. The reporter did not provided the seriousness assessment and considered the events as related to the influenza vaccine. The patient stated that he suspected the flu-shot as the origin of his ills. The patient was not given just a flu-shot, he was administered with an adjuvant intended to boost his immune system and he believed the adjuvant is the cause of his distress. The patient suggested the marketing of FLUAD be more informative that an adjuvant is contained in the vaccine and he believed consumers might misled. Patient believed he either had a bad reaction to FLUAD, got a bad batch, or was administered an overdose of vaccine. It was reported that as he was 65 years he would receive a double dose.

Of the 2,000 comments, 1,887 (94.4%) were relevant to human papillomavirus (HPV). Thus, these 1,887 comments composed their final data-set. The vast majority of comments (n=1,668, 88.4%) originated from unique user accounts. Two hundred and four comments (10.8%) were from users who posted between two and five times, and 30 (1.6%) were from users who posted 10 or more times. Ninety-five (5.0%) comments were coded as having negative sentiment. These comments generally discouraged GARDASIL or GARDASIL 9 vaccination or expressed a particularly negative view toward it. Specific terms characteristic of these comments included ""beware,"" ""destroys lives,"" and ""mystery illness."" While sentiments were nearly always directly incorporated in to the comments themselves, negative sentiment could also often be inferred by the hashtags at the end of the comment. 78 (4.1%) comments explicitly claimed lack of safety. Examples of phrases included in comments describing lack of safety included ""GARDASIL or GARDASIL 9 ruins live [sic]"" and ""girl dies shortly after receiving HPV vaccine."" This case concerns to a healthy 12-year-old girl who died shortly after receiving HPV vaccine. The case was coded as lack of safety 77 (4.1%).

Of the 2,000 responses, 1,887 (94.4%) were relevant to human papillomavirus (HPV). Thus, these 1,887 composed their final data-set. The vast majority (n=1,668, 88.4%) originated from unique user accounts. Two hundred and four tweets (10.8%) were from users who posted between two and five times, and 30 (1.6%) were from users who posted 10 or more times. Ninety-five (5.0%) were coded as having negative sentiment. These  generally discouraged GARDASIL or GARDASIL 9 vaccination or expressed a particularly negative view toward it. Specific terms characteristic of these tweets included ""beware,"" ""destroys lives,"" and ""mystery illness."" While sentiments were nearly always directly incorporated in to the responses themselves, negative sentiment could also often be inferred by the hashtags at the end. 78 (4.1%) explicitly claimed lack of safety. Examples of phrases included in tweets describing lack of safety included ""GARDASIL or GARDASIL 9 ruins live [sic]"" and ""girl dies shortly after receiving HPV vaccine."" This case concerns to a girl who died shortly after receiving HPV vaccine. The case was coded as lack of safety 77 (4.1%). The reporter considered death to be related to GARDASIL 9 and/or GARDASIL.

On an unknown date, the patient received Influenza vaccine unspecified at an unknown dose. On an unknown date, 91 days after receiving Influenza vaccine unspecified, the patient experienced vaccination failure (serious criteria hospitalization and GSK medically significant), influenza B virus infection (serious criteria hospitalization), Stevens Johnson syndrome (serious criteria hospitalization and GSK medically significant), fever (serious criteria hospitalization), nasal congestion (serious criteria hospitalization), rhinorrhea (serious criteria hospitalization), myalgia (serious criteria hospitalization), eruption facial (serious criteria hospitalization), pruritus facial (serious criteria hospitalization), skin lesion  (serious criteria hospitalization), tachycardia (serious criteria hospitalization), tachypnea (serious criteria hospitalization), papule (serious criteria hospitalization), skin plaque (serious criteria hospitalization), vesicles (serious criteria hospitalization), erythropapular rash (serious criteria hospitalization), lymphadenopathy cervical (serious criteria hospitalization), scleral hyperemia (serious criteria hospitalization), lip dry (serious criteria hospitalization), leukocytosis (serious criteria hospitalization), keratinocyte necrosis (serious criteria hospitalization and GSK medically significant), interface dermatitis (serious criteria hospitalization), skin fragility (serious criteria hospitalization), skin erosion (serious criteria hospitalization), generalized eruption (serious criteria hospitalization) and post inflammatory hypopigmentation. The patient was treated with dexamethasone, ibuprofen, famotidine, diphenhydramine, azithromycin, acyclovir, clindamycin, piperacillin sodium, Piperacillin + Tazobactam, oseltamivir and Immunoglobulin. On an unknown date, the outcome of the vaccination failure, influenza B virus infection, fever, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, myalgia, eruption facial, pruritus facial, skin lesion, tachycardia, tachypnea, papule, skin plaque, vesicles, erythropapular rash, lymphadenopathy cervical, lip dry, leukocytosis, keratinocyte necrosis, interface dermatitis, skin fragility, skin erosion and generalized eruption were recovered/resolved and the outcome of the Stevens Johnson syndrome was resolved with sequelae and the outcome of the scleral hyperemia and post inflammatory hypopigmentation were unknown. The reporter considered the vaccination failure, influenza B virus infection, Stevens Johnson syndrome, fever, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, myalgia, eruption facial, pruritus facial, skin lesion, tachycardia, tachypnea, papule, skin plague, vesicles, erythropapular rash, lymphadenopathy cervical, scleral hyperemia, lip dry, leukocytosis, keratinocyte necrosis, interface dermatitis, skin fragility, skin erosion, generalized eruption and post inflammatory hypopigmentation to be related to Influenza vaccine unspecified. Additional information was provided. This case was reported in a literature article and described the vaccination failure in a 2-year-old male who was vaccinated with unspecified seasonal trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (manufacturer unknown). The patient was a previously healthy boy. The patient's household contact had experienced ""flu"" symptoms before current symptom onset. No information on concomitant medication or concurrent condition was provided. On an unspecified date, at the age of 9, 12 and 23 months, the patient received 3 doses of unspecified seasonal trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (administration route and site unspecified; batch number not provided) without incident. The patient's immunizations were up to date. On an unspecified date in the Winter of 2013, 3 months after vaccination, the patient presented with a 5-days history of fever, congestion, rhinorrhoea, myalgia, and a progressive pruritic facial eruption. 2 days before, his paediatrician had started dexamethasone, ibuprofen, famotidine, and diphenhydramine because of suspicion of an allergic skin eruption. There were no known medication exposures, including acetaminophen or ibuprofen, preceding the appearance of skin lesions. Over the next 2 days, skin lesions became widespread, prompting re-evaluation. Vital signs were significant for fever 101 degree F, tachycardia, and tachypnea with normal blood pressure. Skin examination revealed pink, annular, oedematous papules and plaques on the face, trunk, buttocks, and extremities, many with dusky, violaceous centres. Multiple tense vesicles and targetoid erythematous papules were located perianally. Rare serous vesicles were noted centrally, with negative Nikolsky and Asboe-Hansen signs. There was no skin tenderness. Additional findings included cervical lymphadenopathy, mildly injected sclera, and dry crusted lips. There was no genital or palmoplantar involvement. The remainder of the physical examination was unremarkable. Laboratory evaluation revealed leukocytosis (17 x 10E9/L) and high C-reactive protein (10 mg/L). Empiric therapy with azithromycin, acyclovir, and clindamycin was initiated while serologic titers and cultures (urine, skin, blood) were pending. Because of continued fever, piperacillin/tazobactam was added on hospital day 2. A nasopharyngeal swab was positive for influenza B and negative for mycoplasma and 18 other common respiratory pathogens according to a respiratory viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) panel. Oseltamivir therapy was initiated and supportive care provided. Skin biopsy revealed necrotic keratinocytes within the epidermis and an interface dermatitis consistent with the erythema multiforme/Stevens-Johnson syndrome (EM/SJS) spectrum of inflammatory dermatoses. Immunofluorescence studies were negative for immunobullous disease. Antistreptolysin O (ASO), mycoplasma, parvovirus, herpes simplex virus (HSV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and cytomegalovirus titres; surface bacterial and viral cultures; blood culture; and urine culture were negative, and acyclovir and antibiotics were subsequently discontinued. Despite supportive therapy, the patient's eruption rapidly progressed to involve more than 10% of his body surface area, with skin fragility and denudation, requiring transfer to intensive care. Wound care and fluid management continued, and given the progression of cutaneous disease, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) 1 g/kg/d was administered for 3 days, resulting in defervescence and skin stabilization. The patient's lesions re-epithelialized and he was discharged on hospital day 7. He was well with minimal post inflammatory hypopigmentation noted 3 months after hospital discharge. During the following influenza season, after discussion with vaccine safety experts, the child received an unspecified inactivated quadrivalent influenza vaccine containing both influenza B lineages with close monitoring. He tolerated the vaccine well, without any reported adverse reaction after vaccination. The patient subsequently received two additional annual intranasal live attenuated trivalent influenza vaccines without incident. This case has been considered serious due to hospitalisation/vaccination failure. The authors commented, 'After considering available information, experts concluded that our patient's clinical event was consistent with SJS and that influenza B infection was the most likely cause.' The author stated, 'In our case, IVIg may have stabilized disease progression. Controlled clinical trials are needed to better support routine use of IVIg in the treatment of these disorders. Annual vaccination against influenza is recommended for individuals 6 months of age and older. 17 A history of EM, SJS, or TEN after influenza virus infection is not a specified precaution or contraindication, but patients with a similar history should be monitored closely in the post vaccination period. The lack of recurrence of SJS after influenza vaccination in our case may be of interest to providers facing a similar clinical dilemma in the future.'",,,,,Y,7,,,U,,,,"Lab tests were performed on an unspecified date.

I was also exposed to whatever agents drifted downwind from chemical plants and other locations. One day, I was vaccinated against anthrax and other types of biological agents. On the third day, I was exposed to something that exploded in the air above our camp. Eyewitnesses reported a yellow-green chemical cloud resulting from the two explosion spread out and settled over our camp. Within minutes many of us reported burning skin, numbing of the lips and minor to extreme difficulty breathing. I was told that what we heard was just some ""Sonic Booms"". Late March or early April 1991, I became very ill experiencing fever like symptoms and unusual bleeding after each bowel movement until it became necessary to be taken to the nearest hospital. During the following months, my behavior patterns began to change. I became quick-tempered. This was entirely not my personality, especially the loss of control! I recall, during May 1991, I was listening to the speaker during a staff meeting. I was affected by something the speaker had said almost causing me to go into a rage. My supervisor escorted me outside of the meeting and calmed me down. Once I had returned home, I was given a new job, but I found myself often struggling to perform very simple tasks. I just couldn't comprehend what was being said to me. I often began experiencing time as being altered, and events seemed to be happening in slow motion, like an out-of-body experience, observing rather than participating in the experience. In late 1992, I began having violent outbursts usually very early in the morning, always awakening the entire family, my wife began to complain about a burning sensation during and after our sexual intercourse. My wife stated that the semen felt like a fire burning sensation. This continued to get worse until a doctor had to be seen. I began to experience loss of balance (a feeling of falling forward, sideways or backwards). I have no doubt these symptoms are the result of the exposures to a variety of hazardous substances. Presently, I remain burdened with difficulty with short-term memory, irritability and dream like states when I become distressed. I still suffer from bouts of bloody diarrhea, numbness in my finger tips, blurry vision and dizziness, some of which are unexplainable. I feel chronically disabled. I suffer from violent and irrational behavior. At times I am disoriented to the nature and circumstances of my surroundings, unable to understand my immediate actions or the consequences thereof. I have impaired ability to remember, think and reason and now faced with the process of aging in conjunction with serious disability. I can see how my stamina, strength, acuity, agility, energy and mobility slipping away. I am having trouble with my memory, especially learning new information.

Leg would fall, had to hold on to stair rails to stabilze leg otherwise leg would just fall out from under me. Set appoint on December 7th with NP in Dr.'s office.

On 12/21/2017 NP told me that white cell counts elevated but not alarming. Told me I shouldn't take Flu shots, but did not think it was adversly due to flu shot. Schedule in 6 months. Did not think it was Guillian-Barre Syndrome because the patients she saw with that was hospitalized and very bad.  I had asked her about Guillian-Barre Syndrome because the pharmacist I spoke with stated I should be tested for this, and could have only mild symptons and would eventually go away.

733861,1/15/18,,,,,M,,"Initial unsolicited report received from the literature on 04-Jan-2018. The following is verbatim from the article: Abstract A 2-year-old boy with influenza B infection and rapidly worsening targetoid skin lesions with mucosal involvement was diagnosed with Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and treated with oseltamivir and intravenous immunoglobulin, with resolution of illness. Subsequent quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine was well tolerated. This case highlights the rarity of SJS in the setting of influenza B infection and addresses the safety of administering subsequent influenza vaccines to such individuals. This case involves a 24-months-old male patient who was vaccinated with a dose of TRIVALENT INACTIVATED INFLUENZA VACCINE (Batch number, expiration date, dose, dose in series, route and site of administration were not reported) on an unspecified date (also reported as three months before presentation in the hospital). The patient was previously healthy. Other medical history was not reported. Concomitant medications were not reported. On an unknown date, after the vaccination, the patient experienced fever, congestion, rhinorrhea, myalgia and a progressive pruritic facial eruption. So on an unknown date in the winter of 2013, the patient presented in the hospital with a 5-day history of above mentioned events and was hospitalized. On an unknown date (also reported as two days before presentation in the hospital), his pediatrician had started DEXAMETHASONE, IBUPROFEN, FAMOTIDINE, and DIPHENHYDRAMINE because of suspicion of an allergic skin eruption, there were no known medication exposures, including acetaminophen or ibuprofen, preceding the appearance of skin lesions, It was reported that over the next 2 days, skin lesions became widespread, prompting reevaluation, also vital signs were significant for fever 101 degree Fahrenheit, tachycardia, and tachypnea with normal blood pressure and skin examination revealed pink, annular, edematous papules and plaques on the face, trunk, buttocks, and extremities, many with dusky, violaceous centers Multiple tense vesicles and targetoid erythematous papules were located perianally, rare serous vesicles were noted centrally, with negative Nikolsky and Asboe-Hansen signs, there was no skin tenderness. Additional findings included cervical lymphadenopathy, mildly injected sclera, and dry crusted lips. There was no genital or palmoplantar involvement. The remainder of the physical examination was unremarkable. Laboratory evaluation revealed White Blood Cells (leukocytosis) (17 x 109/L) and high C-reactive protein (10 mg/L). Empiric therapy with AZITHROMYCIN, ACICLOVIR, and CLINDAMYCIN was initiated while serologic titers and cultures (urine, skin, and blood) were pending. Because of continued fever, PIPERACILLIN/TAZOBACTAM was added on hospital day 2. A nasopharyngeal swab was positive for influenza B and negative for mycoplasma and 18 other common respiratory pathogens according to a respiratory viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) panel. OSELTAMIVIR therapy was initiated and supportive care provided. Skin biopsy revealed necrotic keratinocytes within the epidermis and an interface dermatitis consistent with the erythema multiforme/Stevens-Johnson syndrome (EM/SJS) spectrum of inflammatory dermatoses. Immunofluorescence studies were negative for immunobullous disease. Antistreptolysin O (ASO), mycoplasma, parvovirus, herpes simplex virus (HSV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and cytomegalovirus titers; surface bacterial and viral cultures; blood culture; and urine culture were negative, and acyclovir and antibiotics were subsequently discontinued. Despite supportive therapy, the patient's eruption rapidly progressed to involve more than 10 percentage of his body surface area, with skin fragility and denudation requiring transfer to intensive care. Wound care and fluid management continued, and given the progression of cutaneous disease, intravenous IMMUNOGLOBULIN (IVIg) 1 g/kg/d was administered for 3 days, resulting in defervescence and skin stabilization. His lesions reepithelialized and on an unknown date in 2013, on hospital day 7, he was discharged from the hospital. On an unknown date, after the vaccination (also reported as three months after hospital discharge), the patient developed minimal postinflammatory hypopigmentation. It was also a case of vaccination failure. It was reported that the patient was previously vaccinated for influenza at 9, 12, and 23 months of age without incident. It was also reported that during the following influenza season, after discussion with vaccine safety experts, the child received an inactivated quadrivalent influenza vaccine containing both influenza B lineages with close monitoring. He tolerated the vaccine well, without any reported adverse reaction after vaccination. Other laboratory investigations and other corrective treatment were not reported. On an unknown date, the patient recovered from influenza B virus infection, myalgia, rhinorrhea, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, fever, facial eruption, pruritus, widespread skin lesions, Skin plaque, papule, vesicles, cervical lymphadenopathy, dry crusted lips, tachycardia, tachypnea and condition aggravated (reported as the patient was well) but the outcome of minimal postinflammatory hypopigmentation was not reported.
